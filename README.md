🔥 There is no need to create a TradingView paid account to receive this strategy / indicator. It can also be used on free and newly established accounts and has no prerequisites for use ‏, but if you have a paid account, the speed of signal processing in TradingView and transfer it to MetaTrader will be higher.

❌ As you know,the financial market will not always proceed based on technical price action, and sometimes the market may go out of technical mode with the publication of a negative or positive news,and then no analysis will be used. 
   So, be careful in your trad and set a SL and use your money management and risk management for trade to avoid large and irreparable losses

   " because you are responsible for all trades "

   The financial market is a market of uncertainty and there is no strategy without the mistakes . we have tried to reduce the amount of mistakes, but we cannot reduce it to zero, so there is a possibility of being SL or loss in trade and  not all trades turn into profit. so it is possible sometime loss in yourself trades.
